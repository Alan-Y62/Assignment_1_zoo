            Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike 
            llamas, they were not bred to be working animals but 
            were bred specifically for their fiber. Alpaca fiber 
            is used for making knitted and woven items, similar 
            to sheep's wool. 
            <br><br>
            Alpacas communicate through body language. The most 
            common is spitting when they are in distress, fearful, 
            or mean to show dominance.[2] Male alpacas are more 
            aggressive than females, and tend to establish dominance 
            of their herd group. In some cases, alpha males will 
            immobilize the head and neck of a weaker or challenging 
            male in order to show their strength and dominance.
