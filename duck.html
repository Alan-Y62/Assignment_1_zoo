            Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl
            in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller and 
            shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are also 
            members of the same family. Divided among several 
            subfamilies, they are a form taxon; they do not represent 
            a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a 
            single common ancestral species), since swans and geese 
            are not considered ducks. 
            <br><br>
            Ducks are an amazing animal. They can fly across the sky.
            They can swim across the sea in both fresh and salt water.
            As well as walk across land.
            They have even adapted to be able to sleep while being alert
            for potential danger. They do so by closing one eye and half 
            of their brain while the other eye and brain stay awake and 
            look out for danger.
